# Documentation

Have your read the [getting started](doc/getting-started) guide?

## Links

Once you have written the home page in `README.md`,
you can start writing other pages in other `.md` files.

For example, with the following files:

    README.md
    doc/getting-started.md
    doc/faq.md

You can can create Markdown links as such and they will work on the website:

```md
[Home](index)
[Getting started guide](doc/getting-started)
[Frequently asked questions](doc/faq)
```

You can of course use these urls for your menu too, they are real valid urls (see below for writing a template).

However, you will need to set up the [HTML `base` tag](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_base.asp)
in your template so that links are relative to the root of your website.

```html
<head>
    <base href="http://username.github.com/yourproject/">
</head>
```

## Template

You can create your own template to customize the generated website.

This is fairly simple, it should look like:

* `template-header.html`
* `template-footer.html`
* `public/` : directory containing static resources (css, js, images...). Its content will be copied to the `gh-pages` branch.

Your template must be in a `gh-pages-template/` directory at the root of your repository.

### Example

Here is a basic example to help you get started:

#### Header

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My project</title>
    <meta name="description" content="This is my project">
    <base href="http://username.github.com/projectname/">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>My brand new project</h1>
        <ul class="menu">
            <li><a href="index">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="doc/index">Documentation</a></li>
        </ul>
    </header>
```

#### Footer

```html
    <footer>
        <p>
            Documentation generated by
            <a href="http://mnapoli.github.com/gh-pages-compiler/" target="_blank">gh-pages-compiler</a>.
        </p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
