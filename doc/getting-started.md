This guide will help you set up *gh-pages-compiler* for your project.

# Getting started

## Choose a hosting

First, you need to decide where will *gh-pages-compiler* be hosted:

* you can use a public *gh-pages-compiler* hosting (coming soon)
* you can install [*gh-pages-compiler* on your own server](doc/install)

## Set up your project

### Home page: README

There usually is a **README** file in every project.
If there is none, you should write one at the root of your project repository.

Here is an example of a README file.
It has to be formatted using the [Markdown language](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).

```markdown
This is the home page for the **AAA project**.

## Features

AAA project offers the following features:

* make coffee in 20 seconds
* print `coffee OK` in the console
```

Save your file as `README.md` (`.md` is for Markdown).

The `README.md` file will be used to generate the **Home page of your website**.
